AQuake2 Clean
=============
Another q2 engine modification based on the original sourcecode release from iD.

I am releasing this code simply to provide a reference for anyone else hacking around in the q2 source and to show
how I managed to get a working build under modern linux, windows and mac osx systems.

Mostly this is a fun sideproject for me and not meant as a serious effort to rebuild quake2.

Naturally any feedback is very welcome.

Tested Platforms
----------------
I have tested the current release builds on Ubuntu Natty and Oneiric x86 and x86_64.

Contributions
-------------
Currently the code is largely iDs with one exception. I have implemented Yamagi's SDL sound subsystem for the linux build.
